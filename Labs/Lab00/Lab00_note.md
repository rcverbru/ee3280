Hello All,

As per request by the Monday lab, we're going to be working on setting up a full environment for you guys to use if you ever need it again later down the line. In order to do this, I'm going to need you all to get some sort of USB drive for you to use during the labs. This drive will act as the boot drive for your linux machine which will allow you to set up a better working environment.

My minimum requirements for this drive is to be at least USB 3.1 and a minimum size of 64GB. __Take note__ that this is the absolute minimum to get. Anything under this will lead to a lower experience with using the usb instead of a vm.

Minimum Suggested: [Samsung 64GB USB 3.1 Flashdrive](https://a.co/d/hpWlA4b)

If you're looking for a good middle ground, my suggestion would be a 128gb drive with USB 3.2 and a read/write speed of 400mbs or more. A drive similar to this will give you the best experience in comparison to a standard build on a computer.
The one I originally started on: [PNY 128 GB USB 3.2 Flashdrive](https://a.co/d/gvVDrZZ)

My second request is that you bring a second but smaller drive that we can use for installation purposes. This drive doesn't need to be too much more than 16gb and once we use it you can go back to using it for daily files.

Please bring both of these drives for the day of your lab section. Although the suggested are linked to amazon, there are many options in Walmart available if needed.
