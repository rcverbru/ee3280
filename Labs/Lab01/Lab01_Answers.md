__1.1.1__ Q. Why might you receive the following error?
```
rcv@Hashbrown:~/ee3280$ cd ee3280/
bash: cd: ee3280/: No such file or directory
```
A. something along the lines of "we are already in the ee3280/ directory and there isn't a ee3280/ folder inside of this directory" mainly just looking to make sure that they know their positioning in their terminal.
