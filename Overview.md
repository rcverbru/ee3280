# Welcome to Ryan and Erik's Starting Guide to ROS #
Throughout these sets of files we're going to try and organize an entry level approach to ROS, Linux, and software development so as to provide a better understanding of each topic. Half the problem with approaching something like ROS is that in order to understand how to use it, one needs to understand a larger portion of the idea and the workings within the whole thing. So don't too concerned with not understanding all of this in your first go around. Things take time and the main goal of this course is to get your feet wet before you head out into industry to work with many of the same topics discussed here.
# Side notes #
Additionally, please take note that in __no way, shape or form__ are we saying that we know everything there is to know about ROS. We am just trying to help shed light into the area from the point of view from our current progress. At the time of writing this, Ryan has been working with ROS for about a year now and this is how the two of us would suggest approaching things as someone new to this course. If you want more information, go read from some of the amazing documentation written down where we learned everything that we know... [The ROS Tutorials](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials). However, the best way to learn all of this is to work with it enough.
# Getting Started #
Now before we begin, here's the generalized structure of the contents that is going to be covered. The aim of this notebook is to build a better guide for each lab that will be thrown at you during the duration of this course as well as supplement the lectures in class.
